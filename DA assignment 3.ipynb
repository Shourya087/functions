What is the difference between a function and a method in Python\n","--Function is a reusable block of code which is used to carry out a specific task\n","eg def sum(a,b):\n","      return a+b\n","method is a function in puthon but it is associated with a class and can not be usee without class object\n","eg class Student:\n","       def func:\n","\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python\n","--function arguments are the objects which are passed in function which have fixed value and parameter are the variables which act as arguments\n","eg. def greet(greeting = \"hi\", name):\n","here greeting is argument and name is a parameter\n","\n","\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python\n","--there are ways to define a function most prominently used are using def keywords or using lambda keyword\n","eg def sum(a,b):\n","      return a+b\n","  add = lambda x,y: x+y\n","calling a function can be done using arguments inside the function or using parameters\n","\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function\n","--as the output of function is inside the function body and it can not be accessed by outer body so return statement is\n","used to tranfer the output of function to outer body\n","\n","\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables\n","--iterables are the collection of  data in python which can be iterated through eg. list, tuple\n","iterators are the way by which data can be iterated through iterators eg. for and while loops\n","\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined\n","--generator is used to make an iterable object which can be accessed using iter and next keyword they defined by using yield at place of return in function\n","\n","\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions\n","--using generator functions dont fully occupy the memory space considering if the calculation is huge or the list we want is huge and can also be faster than regular functions\n","\n","\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used\n","--lambda are the anonymous function which are defined in single line of code they are used when the computation of function is quite simple and easy\n","\n","\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python\n","--purpose of map function is to apply the function to all items of an iterable it is mainly used to convert the data type of items in iterable to other\n","\n","\n","10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python\n","--map function is used to transform one data type to other , reduce is used to reduce the all items of an iterable to single output , filter is used to filter out the data according to need to user from an iterable\n","\n","\n","11.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"14ZLIFrbC8sO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
